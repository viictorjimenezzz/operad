# examples/

Four end-to-end examples — one per pillar of the operad vision. Every
example talks to a **real** LLM via the backend declared in `_config.py`
(defaults: `127.0.0.1:9000`, `google/gemma-4-e2b`; override with
`OPERAD_LLAMACPP_HOST` / `OPERAD_LLAMACPP_MODEL`). No fakes, no
deterministic stand-ins — these are full live runs.

Each example accepts `--offline` as a verify.sh-friendly no-op (prints a
banner and exits 0); without that flag they probe reachability and
exit cleanly with an error if the backend is not up.

| # | Script                                  | What it shows |
| - | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | `01_composition_research_analyst.py`    | A single `await agent(x)` over four nested composition layers (Pipeline ⊃ Parallel × 3 ⊃ Pipeline ⊃ ReAct). 28 typed nodes, 27 edges, all checked at `build()` time. Every leaf is a vanilla `Planner(...)` / `Reasoner(...)` / `ReAct(...)` instance — no subclasses. |
| 2 | `02_talker_reasoner_intake.py`          | The new `TalkerReasoner` algorithm walking a user through a four-stage scenario tree. Exercises stay/advance/branch/finish decisions. The algorithm's class-level navigator + voice are vanilla `Reasoner(...)` instances; the example just passes `config=` through. |
| 3 | `03_train_config_temperature.py`        | A small training loop that tunes `config.sampling.temperature` of a vanilla `Reasoner` via `EvoGradient` with `SetTemperature` mutations. A vanilla `Critic` (wrapped as `RubricCritic`) provides the metric signal. |
| 4 | `04_evolutionary_best_of_n.py`          | A complex training loop: subclassed `EvoGradient` whose `step()` (a) refreshes the mutation pool every generation, (b) launches Best-of-N **in parallel** across all individuals, (c) keeps the top-K survivors. Real `Reasoner` agent + `Critic` judge. |

Run them from the repo root:

```bash
uv run python examples/01_composition_research_analyst.py
uv run python examples/02_talker_reasoner_intake.py
uv run python examples/03_train_config_temperature.py
uv run python examples/04_evolutionary_best_of_n.py
```

`scripts/verify.sh` runs each one with `--offline` (the no-op path) so
CI stays green without a model server. To exercise the live paths,
start a llama-server pointed at the model in `_config.py` and run them
without `--offline`.

## YAML / CLI configuration

`config-react.yaml` + `task.json` are kept for the CLI walkthrough in
the top-level [`README.md`](../README.md):

```bash
uv run operad run   examples/config-react.yaml --input examples/task.json
uv run operad trace examples/config-react.yaml
uv run operad graph examples/config-react.yaml --format json
```

See [`operad/configs/README.md`](../operad/configs/README.md) for the
full schema.
